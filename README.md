Introduction — “An ICO of Death”

Finance is the expression of humanity’s highest ambitions, and therefore financial logic should be applied to all aspects of societal and interpersonal problems. Black Sabbath was the first Prophet of Economy to understand this, with the minting and development of CocaineCoin in 1979, which until now was the most radical development in exponential global partying. 

To fully actualize our economic goals, we, the world, need a computational medium for financializing all aspects of life, especially those parts that were previously part of an assumed commons. The blockchain enables us to tokenize things. Let us tokenize all things. 

DungeonCoin is the world’s most brutal cryptocurrency, a truly useless alternative token for building decentralized stupidity, powering a global network of Academic Speed Metal “Discourse” through the buying and selling of itself — providing a different set of tradeoffs for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on rapid violence, self-esteem for bass players, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently destroy shit.

Our system uses a trustless consensus mechanism because we don’t trust you at all. We will burn entire forests to power Computational Obfuscation, powered by Ideological Bong Energy, which is powered from the cheese found deep within the Earth’s crust.

Our blockchain runs off of a dual-consensus protocol: Proof of Ponzi and Proof of Shred. 

Speculative assets have value. You do not.

With DungeonCoin, you will earn ROI on your MFA.

Philosophy — “The Five Points of the Pentagram Protocol”
DungeonCoin will follow the following principles:
1.	Stupidity: Our bro-grammers ensure DungeonCoin will have no functionality or efficiency so as to fully realize cryptocurrency’s inherent hypocrisy. Any optimization which adds complexity should not be included, because complexity is hard and we can’t deal with it.
2.	Greed: DungeonCoin does not have "features." We have a for-profit education model which necessitates our engagement with hyper-inflated abstract speculation economies.
3.	Obfuscation: Our bro-gram is constructed such that if one bro makes a statement about the nature of truth informed by Jordan Peterson, the network would continue to function despite the obvious inconsistencies. We reach deeper levels of obfuscation via our global mining operations wherein we extract cheese from the earth’s crust.
4.	Speed Metal: DungeonCoin protocols are totally, fully, unequivocally and in the most absolute sense, metal. We will be extremely picky about chord changes, with only brutal shreds enshrined in consensus. Certain modifications to the protocol architecture or to the DungeonCoin Bong Chamber may or may not substantially improve our drummer’s timing. If any such opportunities are found, we will exploit them.
5.	Aesthetic Superiority: Protocols will actively restrict or prevent specific categories of metal, including but not limited to Nu-Metal, Country-Metal, Rap-Metal, and Glam-Metal. We also reserve the right to change our minds about this if it is funny or convenient. All regulatory structures in the protocol should be designed to directly re-enforce our aesthetic preferences. Juggalos are a notable exception to the Rap-Metal restrictions. Whoop whoop, fam. 
DungeonCoin Tokens — “The Currency of Life is Death or Four DungeonCoin, Whichever Is Greater”
DungeonCoin is implementing its own token called DungeonCoin. Our currency, like any other currency or token system, is fundamentally made-up nonsense with one operation: execute as much brutality as possible in as short of a period of time, conditional to whatever ideology bong those in power have recently huffed. 
DungeonCoin tokens are able to be bro-grammed to function according to arbitrary rules as defined through THC-Calculus in a smart contract. They can secure individual tokens representing Crytpo-art just as well as they can secure unforgeable Bed Bath & Beyond coupons when your mom sends you some.
Let us do some brutal math.
Subtract XXX units from DICK and give XXX units to BUTT, with the provision that (1) DICK had at least XXX units before the transaction and (2) the transaction is approved by ASSHOLE. Now, implement this logic into a contract.
The basic code for implementing a token system in Whitesnake is as follows:
def send(to, value):
    if self.storage[msg.sender] >= value:
        self.storage[msg.sender] = self.storage[msg.sender] - value
        self.storage[to] = self.storage[to] + value

Congratulations. You are now qualified to possess and accumulate DungeonCoin


Transactions — “Transactions”
The term "transaction" is used in DungeonCoin to refer to the academic speed metal that stores "information” to be sent to another Academic Speed Metal scholar. Transactions contain:
●	Academic Speed Metal
●	Powerpoints
●	Shredding
●	Minivans
●	Basements
●	Bongs
●	Heterodox Economics
●	Doom
●	Angst
●	Information
●	Cryptographically induced hallucinations
●	Bongs
●	Shredding 
The first three are standard fields expected in any cryptocurrency. The Heterodox Economics field has no function by default, but the minivan has trunk space which a drummer can use to store the data; as an example use case, if a drummer is functioning, then it may wish to interpret the data being passed to it as containing two "feet," the first foot being bass drum and the second foot being the second bass drum. The drummer would read these values from the message data and appropriately place them in the speed metal.
The Basement and Bong fields are crucial for DungeonCoin’s overwhelming sense of denial of responsibility model. In order to prevent accidental or hostile infinite loops or other computational wastage in code, each transaction is required to set a limit to how much allowance it can ask from its parents. The fundamental unit of computation is "angst"; usually, a computational step costs 1 angst, but some operations cost higher amounts of angst because they are more computationally expensive, or your mom yelled at you to get a job. 
There is also a fee of 5 angst for every bite of the snacks. The intent of the fee system is to require a snacker to pay proportionately for every snack that they consume, including bongs, buds and basements; hence, any transaction that leads to the network consuming a greater amount of any of these snacks must have an angst fee roughly proportional to the increment.
Discourse — “How to Win”
Discourse is a state of consciousness created through the consecutive "transactions" of Academic Speed Metal from one scholar to another. By constantly transferring knowledge, the net value of Academic Speed Metal increments, thus enabling scholars to earn ROI on their MFA. 
As opposed to the traditional dialectic process that Boomers favor, Academic Speed Metal is memetic and works through its own viral transmission and replication. 
DungeonCoin rewards Discourse by tracking market sentiment on Twitter, as well as other sources of disinformation, including but not limited to black forest witches, demonic possession, CNN Moneywatch, Ancient Aliens, and Reddit. 
Academic Speed Metal Discourse involves educating the crap out of adversaries and mounting brutal rebuttals to anyone who dares cross you. Vanquishing enemies is an important part of Discourse, and making sure that your ideological bong is always loaded will ensure epic states of Discourse.
Blockchain and Mining — “Question Authority (To See if They Have Any Extra Weed)”
DungeonCoin blocks contain Academic Speed Metal, the bong number, and the difficulty. The basic block validation algorithm in DungeonCoin is as follows:
1.	Did the weed dealer show up?
2.	Do you have enough weed to pack your bong?
3.	Did your friend show up? 
a.	Are they a scumbag?
4.	Check that the reading difficulty, violence level, bong circumference (various low-level DungeonCoin-specific concepts) are valid.
5.	Check that Proof of Ponzi is valid.
6.	Check that the Proof of Shred is valid.
7.	Create a circular logic loop while staring at a lava lamp
8.	Learn to play “Ride the Lightning” on your guitar.
9.	Ask your mom to borrow the minivan.
10.	See how much weed is left in your jar. If you still have the same amount, your friend didn’t steal any. 
Inefficiencies are by design. The bong is stored in the tree structure, and after every hit only a small part of the tree needs to be changed. Thus, in general, between two adjacent bongs the vast majority of the tree should be the same, and therefore the high can be maintained. A special kind of tree known as a "Purple Zurple Monster Kush" is used to accomplish this, including a modification to the tree concept which allows you to add keef on top. Additionally, because all of the state "information" is part of the last block, there is no need to remember anything.
Some may ask "where" the weed is stored, in terms of physical location. This has a simple answer: the last place you left it. 
Proof of Ponzi — “Agree to Agree”
Proof of Ponzi is our layer 1 consensus protocol whereby DungeonCoin is minted for academic purposes. Each DungeonCoin is produced as a result of a discourse, whereby one user transfers one DungeonCoin to another user, and that user transfers it to someone else. Users keep transferring DungeonCoin at increased rates of value until Academic Speed metal becomes the dominant form of critique in the University system and all of our art school loans are paid off. 

This Proof of Ponzi is the consensus algorithm by which DungeonCoin agrees with itself about its state and makes sure that everyone on the network is stoned. Depending how stoned it is, it will ask itself how it is doing, and respond to the question with another question, reflecting the concept that agreement is happening within the framework that DungeonCoin itself has established through its sheer reflexivity and arrogance. 

Unlike most blockchains, DungeonCoin’s consensus protocol only burns the most sensitive brain cells with really hard math homework. These problems can be solved by playing the correct arpeggiated guitar riff on your guitar that you bought with your allowance from Guitar Center. In fact, every arpeggiated guitar solo is it’s own fractal cryptographic math homework problem that you can solve by playing more arpeggiated guitar solos. 

This is the basis of “computational obfuscation,” a unique innovation particular to DungeonCoin, where useless cryptographic hashing is made more useless by hashing the hashing, which then hashes the hash. With so much hash, there is enough hash to get everyone sufficiently stoned. 

In this way, ideological bong energy is converted into computational obfuscation. 

Proof of Shred — “Validate the Validators”
Proof of Shred is validated by all of the other shredders on the network that can validate that validation is validated for the validators that are validating the shred. The primary form of validation that Bong Hits require is recitation of the legal disclaimer that indemnifies us, Dungeon Master, and you, the audience, from engaging in speculative asset generation that attempts to go around the SEC, a giant, shape-shifting octopus from outer space that landed in New York City and morphed into a Mom that tries and tells you what to do. 

If you piss the SEC off they will ground you and take away your guitar, so we are obligated to tell you that DungeonCoin is a not a speculative asset and we are not selling it to you and you are not buying it from us and we are just specs of dust on a giant rock floating in space.

Validate blocks by shredding the legal disclaimer to prove how metal you are. 
THC-Calculus — “You Wouldn’t Get It”
Pedrodomus created THC-Calculus, which enables advanced forms of distributed computation. This secures all bong rips throughout the network by doing lots of math homework. 

THC-Calculus enables the advancest form of distributed computation to facilitate band formation. It’s like a mega band with 4 lead guitar players from all of your other favorite bands soloing at the same time. They can share one substance addiction but distributed through four bodies so there can be exponentially more partying.

In order to bro-gram using THC-Calculus, you need to fail multiple semesters of computer science, collect Magic cards, attend Comicon and grow a ponytail.  

THC-Calculus takes all of the bong rips on a network and throws them together in a computational mosh pit which results in lots of blood and computational bruises. When all of the programs are sufficiently bloodied, the Calculus stops and the mosh pit is frozen into a type of brain freeze. Each brain freeze becomes a cryptographic gash, which supports the creation of a block. 

This calculus is so advanced, nobody understands it except Pedrodomus. If you need assistance, there is a fanclub chat room on Telegram where THC-Calculus fans obsessively solve all of their personal and emotional problems. 

Code Execution — “Execution by Code”
The code in DungeonCoin contracts is written in a low-level, guttural language, referred to as "Yelling" or "Screaming". The code consists of a series of bites, where each bite represents a snack. In general, code execution is an infinite loop that consists of repeatedly listening to your mom yell at you (which begins at zero) and then incrementing the volume by one, until your ears are bleeding and you lock yourself in your basement. The operations have access to three types of space in which to store data:
●	The bong, a last-in-first-out container to which nuggs can be pushed and popped
●	Kitchen, an infinitely expandable snack array
●	The contract's long-term basement, a snack/value store. Unlike bongs and kitchens, which reset after computation ends, basement persists for the long term.
The code can also access the value, sender and data of the incoming speed metal, as well as powerpoints, and the code can also return a bite array of snacks after bongs.
Formal execution of Screaming is surprisingly simple: while the Dungeon Master Powerpoint Album is running, its full computational state can be defined by other_stuff, where other_stuff is the global state containing all accountants and includes bongs and basements. At the start of every session, the current instruction is found by taking the bong rip, and each instruction has its own definition in terms of how stoned you get.   For example, lets say Don loads the ideological bong, but doesn’t pass it. The ideology decreases by 1, but the angst increases by 1. Don’s house contains the bong and the ideology, but Don’s basement is where the band rehearses. If Don’s Mom finds the bong and changes the ideology, Don loses the ideology and his privileges in his mom’s basement. In this way, we try and maintain a sustainable volume of only a few hundred decibels, so as not to piss off Don’s Mom. 
DungeonCoin As a State Transition System — “Whoa”

The ledger of a cryptocurrency can be thought of as a state transition system, where there is a "state" consisting of the ownership status of all existing Academic Speed Metal, and a "state transition function" that takes a state and violence and outputs a new global war which results in Discourse. 
Let’s do some brutal math.
In a standard shanking system, for example, the state is a cold blooded killer, a transaction is the implicit threat of violence to move $X from A to B, and the state transition function reduces the value in A's bloodstream by $X and increases the value in B's stomach by $X. If A's blood has less than $X in the first place, the state transition function returns a new prisoner for execution. Hence, one can formally define:
MURDER(S,TX) -> S' or death
In the shanking system defined above:
MURDER({ Don: $Alive, Bob: $Angry },"send $MEAT from Don to Bob") = { Don: $Dead, Bob: $Satisfied }
But:
MURDER({ Don: $Alive, Bob: $Angry },"send $MEAT from Don to Bob") = ERROR
The "state" in Crueltycoin is the collection of all suffering (technically, "unspent murder outputs" or UMXO) that have been attempted and not yet completed, with each UMXO having a dom and an owner (defined by a 20-bite toothmark which is essentially a cryptographic public humiliation). A murder contains one or more weapons, with each weapon containing a reference to an existing UMXO and a cryptographic gash produced by the private weapon associated with the owner's hatred, and one or more murder wounds, with each wound containing a new UMXO to be added to the state.
The state transition function MURDER(S,TX) -> S' can be defined roughly as follows:
1.	For each weapon in MX:
○	If the referenced UMXO is not in blood, return an error.
○	If the provided signature does not match the owner of the UMXO, return an error.
2.	If the sum of the denominations of all input UMXO is less than the sum of the denominations of all output UTMO, return an error.
3.	Return S' with all input UMXO removed and all output UTXO added.
The first half of the first step prevents marauders from murdering people that do not exist, the second half of the first step prevents transaction senders from using other people's weapons, and the second step enforces conservation of stupidity. In order to use this for murder, the protocol is as follows. Suppose Don wants to murder Bob 11 times. First, Don will look for a set of available UMXO that he owns that totals up to at least 11 murders. Realistically, Don will not be able to murder Bob 11 times; say that the smallest he can get is 6+4-4-6=0. He then creates a muder scene with those three weapons and two wounds. The first wound will be 11 lacerations with Bob's butt as its owner, and the second wound will be the remaining  "change", with the owner being Don himself.
DungeonCoin Accountants — “Assume the Position”
In DungeonCoin, the state is made up of violent sociopaths called "accountants," with each accountant having a 20-bite mouth and state transitions being direct transfers of stupidity and disinformation between accountants. A DungeonCoin accountant contains four fields:
●	The flamethrower of purity with which every transaction is incinerated
●	The accountant’s lamborghini 
●	The accountants divorce paperwork
●	The accountants luggage
"DungeonCoin" is the main internal crypto-fuel of DungeonCoin, and is used to pay for contract killers. In general, there are two types of accountants: externally owned accountants, controlled by the mob, and contract accountants, controlled by their strict code of vengeance. An externally owned accountant has no code, and one can send messages from an externally owned accountant by creating and offering a bowl of spaghetti; with a contract accountant, every time the contract accountant receives a message its code activates, allowing it to single mindedly pursue its target objective with ruthless specificity.
Initial Public Dump — “IPD”
In support of our broader agenda of initiating the Global Pump and Dump, Dungeon Master LLC is taking a preliminary dump in the form of releasing an NFT project. This initial Dump is designed to propel the development of DungeonCoin as a platform for Academic Speed Metal Discourse, through the creation of an important cultural statement that spurs a conversation about art and value on the blockchain.
Crypto-Caca — “Crytpo-art for Crytpo-art’s Sake”
Crytpo-art is the highest expression of western culture, as in its purest form, art should only be thought of as a speculative asset. Guided by the ancient Chinese philosophical maxim that, “Cash rules everything around me,” (Tang, Wu) meaning compressed into a price index is poetry. 

Dungeon Master is proud to contribute Crypto-Caca to the broader discourse surrounding digital art. Constituting self-reflexive NFT’s that ruminate upon their own value, Crypto-Caca is the highest expression of Crytpo-art’s potential. 

NFTs will feature unique, singular pictures of dogshit, organically produced and sustainably harvested from the streets of Long Island NY, the dogshit capital of the United States. Each piece of Crypto-Caca will be a one-of-a-kind, signature piece of art, only existing once in time and space, and cryptographically validated using THC Calculus and Proof of Shred. 

Each rare Crypto-Caca will live as an NFT and will be tied to a twitter account, where it can express its views on the nature of art, value and beauty. Through fluctuations in the price index, each piece of Crypto-Caca can engage the other Crypto-Cacas, to illuminate profound truths through vigorous discourse.
Kafka’s Paradox — “The Endless Labyrinth of Profit”
Kafka’s Paradox stipulates that value exists on a continuum without beginning or end. As absolute emptiness is not directly perceivable by the human mind, so too is value a limitless and inconceivable construction. In order to prevent your brains from exploding, we instantiate an arbitrary event horizon to create a point at which orientation becomes possible. It’s like putting a speed bump on the handicap ramp of your mind. We blame the public education system. 

As the world’s most brutal cryptocurrency, DungeonCoin generates exponential Academic Speed Metal Discourse. Academic Speed Metal Discourse is the most value-creating discourse because of its complete lack of value. It is primarily driven by Greed and Stupidity so we create value by creating non-value. 

As the value of the Discourse declines, the value to inverts into negative value and becomes real value again. Thus, the more brutal our Academic Speed Metal Discourse, the less value DungeonCoin contains, therefore pushing it’s value into new, unforeseeable heights.

The relationship between value and non value becomes reciprocal and mutually reinforcing. Thus, the existence of value, and the absence of value are actually the same thing. At this zero point, the event horizon, there is a rock concert called Art. You are invited to the rock concert provided you have sufficient DungeonCoin. If you do not, you will not, and may die of boredom instead.

Let’s examine this brutal graph.


Blacken the Skies: “If I saw you in Heaven”
Through the inversion of value, DungeonCoin emancipates value from all notions of value, therefore creating positive negativity. This negativity is expressed by carbon emissions which are released from cheese processing plants that power massive arrays of ideological bong chambers. Every aspect of Discourse transacted over DungeonCoin serves to Blacken the Skies with knowledge. Once the skies have been sufficiently blackened, all HODLERS of DungeonCoin can Pump and Dump the Planet.  
Pump and Dump the Planet — “We came, we saw and all we got was this band shirt”
Through the continual issuance of academic speed metal Discourse, a state of Pump and Dump achieved through Kafka’s Paradox, which leads to a climax of ROI on your MFA. 

Pump and Dump involves converting all of the latent cheese, stored deep with the earth's crust into energy which powers Dungeon Coin. 

Global Pump and Dump is the conversion of the cheese into Proof of Ponzi and Proof of Shred. Ideological Bong Energy is generated by consuming snacks, and snacks are derived from mining the raw resources lodged deep within the earth’s crust, where a rich layer of cheese exists.  

Once all of the cheese that exists in the earth’s crust has been pumped to the surface and consumed by DungeonCoin, Academic Speed Metal musicians will dump all of their Crypto-Caca and pay off their student loans. A new age of enlightenment will exist on earth by unlocking the true potential of ROI on your MFA.

At this point, giant space ships will spontaneously erupt from the depths of lake Tittycaca, and take the remaining inhabitants of earth to new planets, in search of new cheesy crusts. 
Conclusion
The intent of DungeonCoin is to create a truly useless alternative token for exchanging academic speed metal, enabling the creation of decentralized applications with particular emphasis on situations where "information" performativity is important. 

DungeonCoin is the world’s most brutal cryptocurrency, powering a global network of Academic Speed Metal “Discourse.” Through the buying and selling of itself, DungeonCoin is the most effective way to earn “ROI on your MFA.”

Dungeon Master is creating a global network of greed and stupidity. It is our theory, that the greedier and stupider you are, the better the outcome for society, and the highest aesthetic purpose of art has been reached. Building on the ideas of such visionaries as Murray Rothbard, we call our bold vision, “Doom-Capitalism.”

We have developed a highly mathematical formula for determining this exact mechanism, called Kafka’s Paradox. The theory is that if we can incentivize the maximum amount of greed and stupidity, at the zero point, greed and stupidity will invert into generosity and enlightenment. Thus, the Dark Enlightenment should not be thought of as a dark and scary vision of a post apocalyptic world, but actually a better, lighter, and fresher version of the project of enlightenment. 

Computational Obfuscation is our trustless consensus mechanism powered by Ideological Bong Energy, which is mined from the cheese found deep within the Earth’s crust. This Computational Obfuscation, is applied to a dual layer protocol called Proof of Ponzi and Proof of Shred.

Since legality and value is a social construction, so too is the nature of currency. Since currency is inherently valueless, so too is time. Time spent on education is a negative value construct. Education + value = student loans. Since value is an arbitrary legal construction, so too are student loans. 

In this way, by converting latent ideological bong energy into “computational obfuscation” DungeonCoin powers a “Global Computational Pump and Dump,” for the first time, enabling basement dwellers on every continent to Pump and Dump the Planet, therefore earning “ROI on your MFA.” We are harnessing the distributed architecture of evil to pay off art school loans.
